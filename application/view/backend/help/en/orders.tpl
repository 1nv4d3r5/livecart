
<p>All the transactions made in your e-store are considered as <strong>orders</strong> which are placed directly by customers (in the storefront) or by 
administrators (of your system). An order contains information about:</p>

<ul>
	<li>goods purchased</li>
	<li>amount of money</li>
	<li>expected delivery date</li>
	<li>etc.</li>
</ul>

Each order is characterized by its <strong>status</strong>:

<ul>
	<strong>
	<li>Queued - </li>
	<li>Failed - </li>
	<li>Complete - </li>
	<li>etc...</li>
	</strong>
</ul>
