
<p>Filters is a tool designed to make product search easy. Instead of browsing product catalog by categories you can create filters that will define 
specific search criteria and allow users to find products in no time. For instance, a filter <i>Bluetooth</i> in a cell phones catalog
will display all the phones that have a  bluetooth feature no matter any other parameters.</p>

<p>It's a common-sence solution that doesn’t force your customer to select the product in pre-set order, instead – the 
customer may filter the products by any property he likes at any point of the process (by adding or removing filters).</p>

<p>(Think of as many filters as possible to create an efficient browsing system as users may be interested in many kinds of attributes your products
have to offer (some may search for products by particular technical details and some may be interested in shape or color)</p>

<p>Let's take a look at a few <strong>examples</strong> to get a better idea how filters work.</p>

<div class="tasks">
<fieldset>
<legend>Things you can do</legend>
<ul>	
	<li><a href="{self}#create">Create a filter</a></li>
	<li><a href="{self}#delete">Delete</a></li>
	<li><a href="{self}#sort">Sort</a></li>
</ul>
</fieldset>
</div>

<h3 id="create">Create Filters</h3>
<p>To create filters you have to define attributes first. Go to the <a href="{help /cat.attr}">Attributes</a> section to create attributes. 
You can create four types of filters: <strong>Options Text (selector)</strong>, <strong>Options Number (selector)</strong>, <strong>Number field</strong>
and <strong>Date</strong>. This means that <strong>Text field</strong> attribute cannot have a filter as you won't be able to define a range of values 
for it.
</p>
<p>We will guide you through several tutorials and show how to generate filters for your existing attributes. As in examples with 
<a href="{help /cat.attr}">attributes</a> in the previuos section we will use cell phones for illustration.</p>

<h4 id="">Creating <i>Bandwidth</i> attribute</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Associate an attribute - select an existing attribute to link them.</li>
	<li>Name - the actual name of the filter which will be displayed in your e-store</li>
	<li>Other languages - if you have more than one languages in your system you can supply translations by clicking on the specific Language.</li>
</ul>

<p>To generate filters, go to Filters section by clicking Filters next to the Main tab. In the Filters section you can generate filters automatically
or set them manually.</p>

<ul>
	<li>To generate filters based on attribute's values, simply click <strong>Generate Filters</strong>. Each filter has three parameters: </li>
	<ul>
		<li>Name - the name of the filter </li>
		<li>Handle</li>
		<li>Value - a value of the attribute to which filter corresponds</li>
	</ul>
	<li></li>
</ul>
