
<p>Filters is a tool designed to make product search easy. Using attributes you can create filters that will define specific search criteria and
allow users to browse your product catalog.</p>

<p><strong>LC introduces a common-sence solution</strong></p> 

<p>A customer may use as many filters as necessary. Our solution doesn’t force the customer to select the product in pre-set order, instead – the 
customer may filter the products by any property he likes at any point of the process.</p>

<p>(What is more, users can customize their search without no limits by adding or removing filters at any time of search.)</p>

<p>(Think of as many filters as possible to create an efficient browsing system as users may be interested in many kinds of attributes your products
have to offer (some may search for products by particular technical details and some may be interested in shape or color)</p>

<p>Let's take a look at a few examples to get a better idea of  </p>

<div class="tasks">
<fieldset>
<legend>Things you can do</legend>
<ul>	
	<li><a href="{self}#create">Create a filter</a></li>
	<li><a href="{self}#delete">Delete</a></li>
	<li><a href="{self}#sort">Sort</a></li>
</ul>
</fieldset>
</div>

<h3 id="create">Create Filters</h3>
<p>To create filters you have to define attributes first. Go to the <a href="{help cat.attr}">Attributes</a> section to create attributes. 
Once you have at least on attribute assigned to a category, click "Add new Filter"<ins>...</ins> </p>

<ul>
	<li>First, you have to associate an attribute with a filter, that will implement existing attribute's values.</li>
	<li>Name - the name of the filter will be displayed for customers to select filtering options.</li>
	<li>Other languages - if you have more than one languages in your system you can supply translations by clicking on the specific Language.</li>
</ul>

<p>To generate filters, go to Filters section by clicking Filters next to Main tab</p>
