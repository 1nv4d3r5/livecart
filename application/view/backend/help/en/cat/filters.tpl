<p>Filters is a tool designed to make product search easy. LC introduces a common-sence solution, filter based system that allows you to cutomize your search the way YOU need it <ins>...</ins></p> 

<p>A customer may use as many filters as necessary. Our solution doesn’t force the customer to select the product in pre-set order, instead – the customer may filter the products by any property he likes at any point of the process.</p>

<p>(Think of as many filters as possible to create an efficient browsing system as users may be interested in many kinds of attributes your products have to offer (some may search for products by particular technical details and some may be interested in shape or color)</p>

<p>To get a beeter idea of how filters are implemented let's take a quick <ins>Tour ...</ins> </p>

<div class="tasks">
<fieldset>
<legend>Things you can do</legend>
<ul>	
	<li><a href="{self}#create">Create a filter</a></li>
	<li><a href="{self}#delete">Delete</a></li>
	<li><a href="{self}#sort">Sort</a></li>
</ul>
</fieldset>
</div>

<h3 id="create">Create Filters</h3>
<p>To create filters you have to define attributes first. Go to the <a href="{help cat.attr}">Attributes</a> section to create attributes. 
Once you have at least on attribute assigned to a category, click "Add new Filter"<ins>...</ins> </p>
