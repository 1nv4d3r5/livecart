To start selling goods in your e-store you have to stock up your system with some products first. LiveCart offers you tools that will help you (to) 
import and keep your product information up-to-date. As in most e-stores LC allows you to manage your products by 
<a href="/livecart//en/backend.help/cat">categories</a>.
