<p>
To start selling goods in your e-store you have to stock up your system with some products first. LiveCart offers
 you tools that will help you add the products and keep the product information up-to-date. As in most e-stores 
 the products are arranged by categories.

<h3 id="view">View and Sort products</h3>
<h4>View</h4>
<p>
	To display category products:
	<ul>
		<li>Click <strong>Products</strong> in the main menu.</li>
		<li>Click a category on the category tree. The Category details tab opens on the right. To view products, 
		click <strong>Products</strong> tab:</li>
		<img src="image/doc/products/products_tab.bmp"/>
		<li>Products are displayed in a table:</li>
		<img src="image/doc/products/products_table.bmp"/>
		By default products are displayed in the order they were added to your store (newest first).
	</ul>
</p> 
<br \>
<h4>Sort</h4>
	<p>LiveCart allows you to <strong>sort</strong> product's almost by any attribute: SKU, name, manufacturer, 
	price etc. 
	To sort products in ascending order click the "up" arrow next to the attribute's name:</p>
	<img src="image/doc/products/arrow.bmp"/>
	<p>To display products in descending order click "down" arrow:</p>
	<img src="image/doc/products/arrow.bmp"/>
	
	You can add or remove products' attributes that are displayed in the toolbar:
	<ul>
		<li>Click <strong>Columns</strong> on the left:</li>
		<img src="image/doc/products/columns.bmp"/>
		<li>Add or remove attributes by checking or clearing a checkbox next to appropriate attribute:</li>
		<img src="image/doc/products/checkbox.bmp"/>
		<li>Click <strong>Change Columns</strong> to save changes.</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<h3 id="find">Locate products</h3>

<p>LC allows you to conduct a search almost by any product's attribute.</p>
<ul>
		<li>Click an attribute to activate a search field:</li>
		<img src="image/doc/products/name2.bmp"/>
		<li>Enter search criteria and press Enter:</li>
		<img src="image/doc/products/name_nokia2.bmp"/>
		Only the products that match your criteria will remain.
	
	</ul>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: product search is carried out only throughout the selected category and its
subcategories. If you want to search all you product catalog, select the root category in the category tree.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Tip</strong>: you can as well use logical operators such as "<" - less or ">" - more 
in your search. For instance, if you want to display products that cost less than 500, simply enter "< 500"
in the price field. You can also search within a particular range. For example, to find products that cost 
from 200 to 500, enter ">200 <500" in the search field.</p>


<h3 id="manage">Manage products</h3>

<p>You can quickly manage products by using <strong>multiple edit</strong> tool which allows you to edit
most of the attributes by applying changes to several products at once.</p>
<ol>
<li>Select one or more products by marking a checkbox on the left:</li>
<img src="image/doc/products/checkboxes.bmp"/>
<li>Choose an action from the menu:</li>

<img src="image/doc/products/select.bmp"/>
<li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
<img src="image/doc/products/save.bmp"/>
</ol>

<p>To edit a <strong>single product</strong>, click product's name in the  list:</p>
