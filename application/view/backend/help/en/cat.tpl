	As in most e-commerce stores, with LiveCart you can manage your products by categories. Categories can also contain subcategories which, in turn, may have their own subcategories. The number of subcategories and subcategory levels is unlimited.

<p>
	Category structure represents how all of the categories are arranged. At the top of the category tree is the Root category which is a parent category for all the descending categories. In the category tree you can easily manage your categories by selecting one of the options: 
</p>

<div class="tasks">
<fieldset>
<legend>Things you can do</legend>
<ul>	
	<li><a href="{self}#add">Create a new category</a></li>
	<li><a href="{self}#remove">Remove a category</a></li>
	<li><a href="{self}#change order">Change category order</a></li>
</ul>
</fieldset>
</div>

<h3 id="add">Create a new category</h3>

<p><del>When creating a new category you are actually/always creating a <i>sub-category</i>, for that you have to click on one of the categories in the category 
tree and click <i>Create new sub-category</i></del> (<ins>sub-category will be changed to category</ins>)</p>

<ins>
	Explain step by step - select parent category first (root category if creating a top level category), then click Create new category, which would create an empty category named "New Category" and that category name, descr,etc. can be changed using the form which will open in tab.
</ins>

<h3 id="remove">Remove a category</h3>

<p>To delete a category: </p>

<ul>
	<li>Choose a category in the category tree</li>
	<li>Click <i>Remove a category</i></li>
</ul>

<p class="note">Deleting a category will also remove all the products associated with the category.</p>

<h3 id="move">Move category</h3>

	<p>Categories can be moved by dragging them directly in the category tree.</p>

<h3 id="change order">Change category order</h3>

	<p>Category order can be changed by using <i>Move-up</i> and <i>Move-down.</i> menu commands.</p>
