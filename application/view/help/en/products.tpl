<p>
To start selling goods in your e-store you have to stock up your system with some products first. LiveCart offers
 you tools that will help you add the products and keep the product information up-to-date. As in most e-stores 
 the products are arranged by categories.
</p>

<div class="tasks">
<fieldset>

<h3 id="view">View and Sort products</h3>
<p>
	To display products of a particular category:
	<ol>
		<li>Click on the "Products" tab in the main menu.</li>
		<li>Then select a category on the category tree.</li>

		By default products are displayed in the order they were added to your store (newest first, oldest - last).
	</ol>
</p> 
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To view all products, select the most top category.</p>


<h4>Sorting products</h4>
	<p>LiveCart allows you to sort product's almost by any attribute: SKU, name, manufacturer, 
	price, stock, status. 
	To sort products in ascending order click the arrow next to the attribute's name. To display products in descending order click the arrow one more time.</p>
	<img src="image/doc/products/arrows.bmp"/>

	
	You can add or remove products' attributes that are displayed in the toolbar:
	<div id="columns">
	<ol>
		<li>Click "Columns" on the right:</li>
		<img src="image/doc/products/columns.bmp"/>
		<li>Select or remove attributes by checking or clearing a checkbox next to appropriate attribute:</li>
		<img src="image/doc/products/checkbox.bmp"/>
		<li>Click "Change Columns" to save changes.</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<h3 id="find">Find products</h3>

<p>LC allows you to conduct a product search almost by any product's attribute. See how to <a href="{self}#columns">changes attributes</a></small> that are displayed in the toolbar.</p>
<ul>
		<li><ins>select category</ins></li>
		If you want to search all you product catalog, select the root category in the category tree.
		<li>Click an attribute to activate a search field:</li>
		<img src="image/doc/products/name2.bmp"/>
		<li>Enter search criteria and press Enter:</li>
		<img src="image/doc/products/name_nokia2.bmp"/>

	</ul>

<p class="note">You can as well use logical operators to customize your search. Click on the "Magnifying glass" icon to select an appropriate operator.
For example, if you want to display products that cost less than 500, select "< Less than" operator and enter "500"
in the price field and press "Enter". (You can also search within a particular range. For example, to find products that cost 
from 200 to 500, select "Range" and enter "200" and "500" accordingly.)</p>

<p>You can quickly manage products by using <strong>multiple edit</strong> tool which allows you to edit
most of the attributes by applying changes to several products at once.</p>
