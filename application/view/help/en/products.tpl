<p>
To start selling goods in your e-store you have to stock up your system with some products first. LiveCart offers
 you tools that will help you add the products and keep the product information up-to-date. As in most e-stores 
 the products are arranged by categories.
</p>

<div class="tasks">

<h3 id="view">View and Sort products</h3>
<h4>(View)</h4>
<p>
	To display products of a particular category:
	<ol>
		<li>Click <strong>Products</strong> in the main menu.</li>
		<li>Then select a category on the category tree.</li>
		<li>The Products tab opens on the right. Products are displayed in a table (similar to this):</li>
		<img src="image/doc/products/products_table.bmp"/>
		By default products are displayed in the order they were added to your store (newest first, oldest - last).
	</ol>
</p> 

<br \>

<h4>(Sort)</h4>
	<p>LiveCart allows you to <strong>sort</strong> product's almost by any attribute: SKU, name, manufacturer, 
	price, stock, status. 
	To sort products in ascending order click the "up" arrow next to the attribute's name. To display products in descending order click the "down" arrow.</p>
	<img src="image/doc/products/arrows.bmp"/>

	
	You can add or remove products' attributes that are displayed in the toolbar:
	<div id="columns">
	<ol>
		<li>Click <strong>Columns</strong> on the right:</li>
		<img src="image/doc/products/columns.bmp"/>
		<li>Select or remove attributes by checking or clearing a checkbox next to appropriate attribute:</li>
		<img src="image/doc/products/checkbox.bmp"/>
		<li>Click <strong>Change Columns</strong> to save changes.</li>
	</ol>
</p>

<h3 id="find">Find products</h3>

<p>LC allows you to conduct a product search almost by any product's attribute. See how to <a href="{self}#columns">changes attributes</a></small> that are displayed in the toolbar.</p>
<ul>
		<li>Click an attribute to activate a search field:</li>
		<img src="image/doc/products/name2.bmp"/>
		<li>Enter search criteria and press Enter:</li>
		<img src="image/doc/products/name_nokia2.bmp"/>
		Only the products that match your criteria will remain.
	
	</ul>

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: product search is carried out only throughout the selected category and its
subcategories. If you want to search all you product catalog, select the root category in the category tree.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Tip</strong>: you can as well use logical operators such as "<" - less or ">" - more 
in your search. For instance, if you want to display products that cost less than 500, simply enter "< 500"
in the price field. You can also search within a particular range. For example, to find products that cost 
from 200 to 500, enter ">200 <500".</p>


<h3 id="manage">Manage products</h3>

<p>You can quickly manage products by using <strong>multiple edit</strong> tool which allows you to edit
most of the attributes by applying changes to several products at once.</p>

<ol>
<li>Select one or more products by marking a checkbox on the left:</li>
<img src="image/doc/products/checkboxes.bmp"/>
<li>Choose an action from the list:</li>

<li>Click <strong>Save</strong> (for the changes to take place immediately).</li>
<img src="image/doc/products/save.bmp"/>

<p>To edit a <strong>single product</strong>, click product's name in the  list:</p>
<img src="image/doc/products/click_product.bmp"/>
