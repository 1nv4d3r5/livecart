	<h3>Manage Languages</h3>
	<p>LC allows/enables you to adjust your shop for international usage, to prepare translations for other languages you have to set the interface (objects')
	translations and all the available stock information (description details, for instance.). This may seem overhelming at first but as you will see there
	a couple of handy tools to help you deal with interface translations (see LiveTranslation)</p>
	
	<p>LiveCart supports multiple languages for the same system, which enables you to adjust your shop for international usage. You can translate both interface information (menus, captions, instructions, etc.), as well as most of the data, which is stored in the system, like product descriptions, category names and others. This may seem overhelming at first but as you will see there a couple of handy tools to help you deal with interface translations (see Live Translation).</p>
	

	<h3>Things you can DO</h3>
	<ul>	
		<li>Add a new language</li>
		<li>Set (edit) translations</li> 
		<li>Apply language to the interface</li>
		<li>Sort / Reorder languages</li>
		<li>Set Active / Inactive</li>
		<li>Set default language (interface lang. diference)</li>
		<li>Delete language</li>
	</ul>
	<br />

	<p>Adding a language is a one step task. Simply select language from the list and click OK. Added languages appear below automatically.</p>
	<p>To translate a language proceed to the Language translation page. To do this hover over the language and click a "pen" icon</p>
	<p>To apply new language to the interface, click Change Language in the LC's main window and choose a language from the list dipslayed. <span style="background: #ffff99">Note: if the language is not fully translated it will use translations from the dafault language to fill in empty translations (see setting Default Language)</span></p>	
	<p>To reorder languages click on any language and drag it around to set the preferred arrangement (Language arrangement affects the order in which languages are displayed in language switching menus).</p>
	<p>All (the newly added)languages are inactive by default. You might want to keep a language inactive while you are still translating it(the interface or product data). To activate a language mark it's check_box on the left of the flag icon. (Also) note that only active languages are available in the change iterface language meniu.
	To suspend a language clear a check_box by the language you want to deactivate.</p>
	<p>Note that Default language in LC does not mean the MAIN (in what way...?) language of the interface, instead the default language is main for displaying stock info, (...) </p>
	<p>To delete a language, hover over it and click the delete icon on the left.</p>
