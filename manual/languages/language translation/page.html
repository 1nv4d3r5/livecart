	<h3>Language translations</h3>
	<p>Here you can set up translations by supplying keywords with appropriate definitions</p>
	

	<h3>TO DO list</h3>
	<ul>	
		<li>How do I set definitions for the interface elements (objects)?</li>
		<li>How do I translate products info?</li>
		<li>How do I find a specific keyword?</li>
		<li>(How to dislpay only translated words / not translated?)</li>
		<li>How do I find keyword in the interface (to know what keyword I am translating) </li>
	</ul>
	
	<br />
	
	<p>Definitions can be set in the keyword tree below the Translation Filter. Keywords are classified by the interface layout ...</p>
	<p>To set translations for the language you can choose "Not translated" in the Translation filter to dislpay keywords that have not been 
	defined yet. This will cause the keyword tree to expand below. In case the tree seems too complex you might try browsing it by category branches. 
	Simply collapse unwanted (irrelevant) result sections and start at any point you need.</p>
	<p>You can set product info only in Products and Categories section (see Link for more info)</p>
	<p>If you need to find a specific word or edit a definition, use a Search field in the Translation Filter area</p>
	<p>You can have keywords filtered by their current status in terms of translation process. You can select the following filtering options:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span style="background: #ffff99">All</span> – show all the existing words</li>
		<li><span style="background: #ffff99">Translated</span> – display only translated items</li>
		<li><span style="background: #ffff99">Not translated</span> – show items that have not been translated</li>
	</ul>
	<p>(There is no graphical representation of the keyword's object you are working on. Try to trace keyword's actual place by the category it is assigned to)</p>
