	<h2>Translate languages</h2>
	<p>Here you can set up translations by supplying keywords with appropriate language definitions.</p>
	

	<h3>TO DO list</h3>
	<ul>	
		<li><a href="#interface elements">Translate interface elements</a></li>
		<li><a href="#find specific word">Find and translate a specific word or sentence</a></li>
		<li><a href="#find missing translations">Find missing translations</a></li>
		<li><del>How do I find keyword in the interface (to know what keyword I am translating)</del> </li>

	<h3>Translate interface elements</h3>
	
	<p>There are two ways of translating the interface - either by using the language translation panel or <a href="#directly from user interface">Live Translation</a>.</p>
	
	<p>Translation definitions can be set in the keyword tree below the Translation Filter. Keywords are categorized as they appear in the interface layout. (help on navigating the tree?)</p>
	<p>You can set products info only in the Products and Categories section. All the translations are set in the apropriate Products and Categories section, for instance Category Details are set in the Category Details Tab and so on. (see Link for more info)</p>

	<a name="find specific word" />
	<h3>Find and translate a specific word or sentence</h3>

	<p>If you need to find a specific keyword or edit a definition, use a Search field in the Translation Filter area. Translations will also be searched by their value in English as well as keyword name.</p>	

	<a name="find missing translations" />
	<h3>Find missing translations</h3>	
	<p>You can have keywords filtered by their current status in terms of translation process. You can choose from the following filtering options:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span style="background: #ffff99">All</span> – show all the existing words</li>
		<li><span style="background: #ffff99">Translated</span> – display only translated items</li>
		<li><span style="background: #ffff99">Not translated</span> – show items that have not been translated</li>
	</ul>
	
	<a name="directly from user interface" />
	<h3>Translate a word or sentence directly from user interface</h3>	
		
	<p>Live Translation is a LiveCart tool that allows you to translate a word or sentence directly from the page you see it in. To use Live Translation, you have to turn on the Customization Mode... <ins>(not completed yet)</ins></p>
		
	<p>(There is no graphical representation of the keyword's object you are working on. Try to trace keyword's actual place by the category it is assigned to)</p>
	
	<a name="product info" />
	<h3>Translate product info</h3>	
		
	<p>You can translate product, category, attribute and other data directly from their management pages, for example, product modification page. The fields to enter the translations are typically placed underneath the main data form.</p>
