It&#8217;s chock full of good gift ideas for designers.</p>

<p>One of <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com">Edward Tufte</a>&#8217;s <A HREF="http://tinyurl.com/yhhm5q">presentation tips</a> is &#8220;Never apologize.&#8221;</p>


<blockquote>Never apologize. If you&#8217;re worried the presentation won&#8217;t go well, keep it to yourself and give it your best shot. Besides, people are usually too preoccupied with their own problems to notice yours.</blockquote>

	<p>True that. Presenting, like performing, relies a lot on confidence (or at least the illusion of confidence). If you get up and begin with an apology, you&#8217;ve already undermined your own credibility and dug yourself a big hole.</p>


	<p>Plus, apologizing before a presentation is insulting to the audience. If you get up on stage in front of people, you&#8217;ve got to believe that what you&#8217;re offering them, even if not perfectly honed, is worthwhile. If you don&#8217;t think so, why should they?</p>


	<p><strong>The power of the pause</strong><br />
There&#8217;s also a Tufte tip that says, &#8220;Be sure to allow long pauses for questions.&#8221; I think the intended meaning here is take your time while waiting for questions. But I&#8217;d like to add a related thought: It&#8217;s alright to pause <em>before answering</em> a question too.</p>


	<p>When someone fires a question at you, there&#8217;s an instinctual feeling that you&#8217;ve got to respond instantly, especially if you&#8217;re billed as an &#8220;expert.&#8221; You want to show that you&#8217;ve got an instant answer.</p>


	<p>If you have a response on the tip of your tongue, that&#8217;s great. But sometimes it can be a good idea to pause and think about the question, what your response is, and how you want to phrase it. I&#8217;m not talking a half-hour lull or anything. Just a few seconds to collect your thoughts in your brain before they come out your mouth.</p>


	<p>Unlike opening with an apology, a brief pause doesn&#8217;t come across as weak or flabby. It makes you seem like you care about your answer. It shows respect for the question, the questioner, and the audience. And it makes them want to listen.</p>


	<p>In this age of instant information, there&#8217;s something strangely satisfying about someone who takes a moment to formulate an answer in order to deliver a coherent, thought-out response.</p>

<p>Just recently, we hired a new systems administrator named Mark. He lives in Virginia. That&#8217;s six hours off the <span class="caps">GMT</span>. One less than the current five guys in Chicago. Two less than Jamis in Idaho. So what?</p>


	<p>He was the best of the candidates available, we&#8217;d be crazy not to pick him up, no? Well, apparently there are still plenty of &#8220;crazy&#8221; companies and hiring managers out there. People unwilling to pick the better candidate because of geography.</p>


	<p>Jonathan gives us just one example in his <a href="http://starkravingcalm.com/archives/an-open-letter-to-job-board-advertisers">an Open Letter to Job Board Advertisers</a>. So I thought this would be a good occasion to get the excuses out there: Why are you not hiring remote workers?</p>

<p>Animators deal with art, story, etc. so there is a lot of intuition and &#8220;feel&#8221; required. At the same time, effective design is key; Animations have to communicate concrete ideas and emotions. It&#8217;s an interesting intersection of intuition and reason. <a href="http://www.animationmeat.com/notes/waltstanchfield/waltstanchfield.html">The drawing class notes</a> (<a href="http://punchandbrodie.com/leo/stanchfield/">book form</a>) of Walt Stanchfield, drawing instructor for Walt Disney Studios, provide a fascinating look at the process. Below are excerpts from Stanchfield&#8217;s handouts (all links go to PDFs, bold emphasis mine).</p>


	<p><a href="http://www.animationmeat.com/pdf/waltstanchfield/48ws_simplicity.pdf">Simplicity for the sake of Clarity</a>:</p>


<blockquote>The artist, when he first gets an inspiration or tackles a pose in an action analysis class, sees the pose, is struck by its clarity, its expressiveness, then after working on it for a while that first impression is gone and with it goes any chance of capturing it on paper. That&#8217;s the reason. <strong>we should learn to get that first impression down right away</strong> &#8211; while it&#8217;s fresh, while it&#8217;s still in that first impression stage &#8211; before it starts to fade&#8230;<br /><br />

	<p>The reason I keep harping on &#8216;forget the detail&#8217; for this particular type of study is, the detail doesn&#8217;t buy you anything at this stage of the drawing. Doodling with detail will cause you to lose that first impression&#8230;When I say locate and suggest, that is exactly what and all you need. What you are drawing is a pose not parts. <strong>The simplest kind of suggestion is the surest way to a good drawing.</strong> I have xeroxed a little series of drawings from &#8220;The Illusion of Life&#8221; to show how an extremely simple sketch can express so much and thereby be a perfect basis for the final drawings.</blockquote></p>


	<p><a href="http://www.animationmeat.com/pdf/waltstanchfield/48ws_simplicity.pdf" class="image"><img src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/48ws_simplicity.png" width="450" height="204" alt="simplicity" /></a></p>


	<p><a href="http://www.animationmeat.com/pdf/waltstanchfield/24ws_drwing_verbs.pdf">Draw Verbs Not Nouns</a>:</p>


<blockquote>A sure way to keep from making static, lifeless drawings is to think of drawing &#8220;verbs&#8221; instead of &#8220;nouns&#8221;. Basically, a noun names a person place, or thing; a verb asserts, or expresses action, a state of being, or an occurrence. I speak often of shifting mental gears, and here is another place to do it. The tendency to copy what is before us without taking time (or effort) to ferret out what is happening action- wise, is almost overwhelming.</blockquote> 

	<p>(A similar thought can be found at <a href="http://schulzeandwebb.com/blog/2006/11/22/the-life-of-products/">The life of products</a>: &#8220;Products are not nouns but verbs. A product designed as a noun will sit passively in a home, an office, or pocket. It will likely have a focus on aesthetics, and a list of functions clearly bulleted in the manual…but that’s it. Products can be verbs instead, things which are happening, that we live alongside&#8230;a product designed with this in mind can look very different.&#8221;)</p>

<p>There&#8217;s this little storefront on Ashland Avenue in Chicago&#8217;s Bucktown neighborhood called <a href="http://www.marrakechcuisine.com/">Marrakech Cuisine</a>. If you&#8217;re not looking for it you&#8217;d ignore it. And if you were looking for it you might even think it was the wrong place.</p>


	<p>In the front you&#8217;ll find authentic Moroccan lamps, <a href="http://www.marrakechcuisine.com/images/store_pics/pages/AI_craft%20083.html">hand-made jewelry</a>, wood carvings, boxes, and <a href="http://www.marrakechcuisine.com/images/store_pics/pages/000_0011.html">other imported curiosities</a>. But the real treasure is in the <a href="http://www.marrakechcuisine.com/images/restaurant_pics/pages/000_0140.htm">sunken, dimly lit room</a> in the back.</p>


	<p>The first treasure is <a href="http://www.marrakechcuisine.com/images/restaurant_pics/pages/000_004.htm">the owner.</a> He&#8217;s a gentle, soft spoken man with a smile baked into his face. He sells you the lamps, he takes your order, he cooks your food, he serves your food, and he rings you up. He&#8217;s not quick, but there&#8217;s no reason to rush.</p>


	<p>The second treasure is the food. The <a href="http://www.marrakechcuisine.com/menu.html">menu</a> is simple and fairly priced. Everything I&#8217;ve tried is good &mdash; especially the Harrira, the Lentil Salad, and the Atlas Tajine. This is food made by someone who cares about what he cooks and what you eat. The ingredients are fresh, and the flavors are just right, and the portions are proper (read: not too big).</p>


	<p>Finishing off the meal with some tea made from fresh mint leaves, rosewater, and the slightest touch of honey is highly recommended. It goes well with his homemade sticky Baklawa.</p>


	<p>This place is such a great escape from the busy street and the fussy cuisine that&#8217;s popping up all over. You&#8217;ll never need a reservation. Don&#8217;t be alarmed if you&#8217;re the only one there. It&#8217;s guaranteed good food with a truly personal touch that seems rare these days.</p>


	<p>I would have never walked in this place had someone not recommended it to me. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m passing on my recommendation to you. Good eats.</p>

<p><strong>Amphibian Design</strong><br />
<a href="http://amphibian.info/about/">The about page at Amphibian Design</a> scores high on the &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t mind grabbing a beer with that guy&#8221; scale.</p>


<blockquote>Amphibian is a graphic design and digital construction empire with humble beginnings in a one bedroom apartment in Winnipeg, MB, Canada. Today it has grown to have offices in &#8230; well, one city &#8230; and employ over &#8230; well, just one person worldwide. Nonetheless, Print Magazine&#8217;s 2005 Design Annual called Amphibian &#8221;... a design agency I&#8217;ve never heard of.&#8221;*<br /><br />

	<p>I&#8217;ve been designing and building websites, posters, brochures, CD packaging, business cards, and other various forms of communication in the physical and virtual world since 1997. Sure, some of those early projects were &#8220;learning experiences.&#8221; <cough> However I think my body of work today speaks for itself.<br /></p>


	<p>Those with few resources who are working for peace and justice in this sad world have been known to get quoted on a sliding scale according to need, funding, and my own personal passion for their project.</blockquote></p>


	<p>It&#8217;s an oft overlooked secret to getting hired: Be likeable. A lot of &#8220;hire me&#8221; energy is spent on showing off and looking professional &mdash; education this, portfolio that, etc. But when you&#8217;re trying to attract moths to your flame, a friendly vibe and an easy-going attitude are a great place to start. Plus, you&#8217;re more likely to attract clients with the same attitude which can help lead to a saner existence.</p>


	<p>(Btw, check out the subtle gradients at <a href="http://amphibian.info/contact/">the site&#8217;s contact form</a> and the in-your-face <a href="http://amphibian.info/">cover shot</a>.) [tx <a href="http://www.blockhunter.com/">Andy</a>]</p>


	<p><strong>Jewelboxing tells a story</strong><br />
People like stories a lot more than sales pitches. <a href="http://www.jewelboxing.com/blogarchive.php?note=000692.php">One Thing Leads to Another</a> tells the tale of how Jewelboxing came to be. Stories like this are a great way to show you truly care about what you make and create a connection with your audience.</p>


<blockquote>After all the work that went into the shooting and editing and everything else it seemed like printing out some color sheets and putting the disc in a regular old jewel case was not the best way to make a first impression. We&#8217;re pretty good at finding things here and over the next couple days we looked at virtually every single disc packaging option available anywhere and decided that they all stunk.<br /><br />

	<p>Kevin had saved a promo disc of stock photography he received from Getty, not because we needed another disc full of serious looking businessmen pointing at computer screens or happy people on the phone, but because of the slick, modern hinged case it arrived in. We tracked down another, ripped all the paper out of them and then made our own inserts and sent the Slowtron series winging its way across the Atlantic. I&#8217;ll let you know what happens with that.</p>


	<p>Anyhow, it didn&#8217;t take us too long to realize that there must be other firms and individuals who like us, wanted to put as much thought and effort into what our presentations discs were packed in as we did with the material that we were burned on them.</blockquote></p>

<p>We just launched a revised version of our <a href="http://www.37signals.com">home page</a>. The redesign took about 2 days from paper to screen to launch.</p>


	<p><a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/new37-spread.png" class="image"><img src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/new37-spread-small.png" width="460" height="339" /></a>
New on the left, old on the right.</p>


	<p>The goal was to tighten up the design, say more with less words, and hone our overall message. We wanted to shine the spotlight on our current three paying apps (Basecamp, Backpack, and Campfire). The redesign also gave us an opportunity to commit to <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/whitney/index.html">a new typeface</a> we&#8217;ve been itching to use for a while now. I see <a href="http://www.simplebits.com/notebook/2006/12/04/rebrand.html">we&#8217;re not the only ones</a> who like that type.</p>


	<p>There was one other goal: begin to unify the design, layout, and <span class="caps">HTML</span>/CSS of our corporate and product sites. This new design will serve as a template for our redesigned product sites which we&#8217;ll begin to roll out in 2007.</p>


	<p>It feels good to start with a clean <span class="caps">CSS</span> slate. New sheet, no legacy. New foundations are fun to build.</p>

<p>Sometimes during software development you need to hack something together temporarily just to see it working. You have no intention of leaving it like that.</p>


	<p>We recently needed to add an email field to something we&#8217;re working on. And to make sure we didn&#8217;t forget about it we made it ridiculous.</p>


	<p><img src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/emailpaddy.gif" width="400" height="60" alt="email p addy" /></p>


	<p>Now it works, but we can also tell it&#8217;s not finished. And we can have a laugh about it.</p>


	<p>There are other techniques too. You could set up a <span class="caps">CSS</span> class called &#8220;temporary&#8221; that throws a ugly thick purple border around things you know are temporary.</p>


	<p>Or you could just keep a log somewhere, but we think it&#8217;s better to show the temporariness on the screen itself instead of on a piece of paper that may or may not be accurate and comprehensive.</p>


	<p>What techniques have you used to keep ugly temporarily-necessary hacks from slipping into your final release?</p>

<p>There should be an alternative to one-size-fits-all <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds for busy sites. Too many high-volume sites assume everyone wants to read every post. That&#8217;s wishful thinking. Some readers may want 5+ posts a day from your site, but what about moderate fans who only want 5 posts a week? Or casual fans who want a mere 5 posts a month? These people just want a glass of water yet sites insist on pointing a firehose at them.</p>


	<p><strong>The <span class="caps">RSS</span> avalanche</strong><br />
In <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/archives/2006/1129_all_feeded_u.php">All Feeded Up</a>, Khoi discusses the challenge of surviving the <span class="caps">RSS</span> avalanche:</p>


<blockquote>I’ve collected so damn many <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds that, when I sit down in front of the application, it’s almost as difficult a challenge as having no feed reader whatsoever. With dozens and dozens of subscriptions, each filled with dozens of unread posts, I often don’t even know where to start.<br /><br />

	<p>In the past, friends have advised me to just narrow my list down to a manageable number of essential subscriptions — a bare few that I can consume easily, day in and day out. But every time I try to do that, I find that I can’t really bear to get rid of most of these feeds. They all seem essential, and I’m loathe to give any of them up. Of course, I understand the corollary of that reluctance: refusing to part with most of these feeds means I’ll probably continue to benefit from very few of them.</blockquote></p>


	<p>I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s alone. A lot of people want to keep up with what&#8217;s going on at a specific <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed but don&#8217;t have the time to read everything there. So people wind up following the advice of Khoi&#8217;s friends &mdash; ruthless pruning of any feed deemed inessential, even though <em>some</em> of the content there is desired.</p>


	<p>If content was filtered better, these on-the-fence sites would at least have a chance to stick around. Here are a few options for filtering <span class="caps">RSS</span> feeds so they&#8217;re not just an all or nothing proposition for readers:</p>


	<p><strong>The author decides</strong><br />
In this approach, authors decide which posts qualify for a &#8220;greatest hits&#8221; feed. Those top posts are published separately in an abridged, cream-of-the-crop feed.</p>


	<p><a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/top/"  class="image"><img src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/lifehacker_top.png" width="438" height="73" alt="lifehacker top stories" /></a></p>


	<p>For example, Gawker blogs, which usually publish double digit posts per day, tag noteworthy posts &#8220;top&#8221; and then people can subscribe to this tag instead of the entire feed (<a href="http://www.lifehacker.com/software/top/">top stories at Lifehacker</a> and <a href="http://www.idolator.com/tunes/top/">Idolator</a>, for example).</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a big difference between trying something and using something.</p>


	<p>Trying something is more common than using something. That&#8217;s why most products are optimized for trying.</p>


	<p>Trying something is looking at some screenshots, signing up, playing with it for a couple of minutes, forming an opinion, and then moving on. Trying is mainly about first impressions and surface appeal.</p>


	<p>Most product reviews are based on trying something, not using something. That&#8217;s why many reviews are pretty thin or don&#8217;t get to the core essence of the product. The real deep knowledge of a product can only come from using it. Using it is what reveals greatness or failure on an intimate level.</p>


	<p>You don&#8217;t notice the quirks and shortcuts when you try something. Those revelations only come from real use. Eye candy shines during trial, but fades fast during use. Cool wears off quick, usefulness never does.</p>


	<p>Think of the difference between something painted gold and something made of gold. They&#8217;re both gold now, but once the paint wears off the first one you&#8217;re looking at something different. On the other hand the solid gold one continues to be gold no matter how much you use it.</p>


	<p>In some ways it&#8217;s the difference between meeting someone and knowing someone. You don&#8217;t know someone until you&#8217;ve really spent some time with them. How do they react in certain situations? Are they kind or only friendly on the surface? Are they smart or can they just recite a few facts? The same goes for a product. How does the product react? Is the product just clever enough or is it too clever? How does the product make you feel when you use it?</p>


<hr>

	<p><strong>... I don&#8217;t know how to end this post, but I&#8217;ve been sitting on the content for about a week now so I figured I&#8217;d share it as is.</strong> It&#8217;s been a frustrating post to put together and I&#8217;m not sure why. I&#8217;m having a difficult time clearly explaining why the difference between trial and usage is such an important distinction. Anyone care to finish my thoughts?</p>

      <DD>&#8220;It is very important to be cognizant that while the connection between our eyes and our brains has never been better, our eyes themselves are tired. One of the challenges that the design profession has is that the overwhelming majority of people constructing designs in 2006 are generally under the age of 30. And one of the persistent problems that they have is that they are designing for themselves and not for the larger audience&#8230;We live in a world in which time is in a state of acceleration. And therefore the perception of ease is as important as the reality of ease.&#8221;</DD>

<p><em>[&#8220;On Writing&#8221; is a new category of SvN post that offers examples of interesting online copy.]</em></p>


	<p><strong>Freshbooks responds to downtime</strong><br />
It&#8217;s easy to provide great service when things run smoothly. Handling problem situations is a much tougher &mdash; and often more important &mdash; test. Freshbooks&#8217; <a href="http://www.freshbooks.com/blog/2006/08/30/update/">Up and Running</a> blog post is an example of how to do it right.</p>


	<p>The company experienced a hardware failure which resulted in downtime and some loss of data. Bad news for sure. But the company&#8217;s response, including a detailed explanation and a free upgrade for all accounts, defused the situation and turned a negative into a positive.</p>


	<p>Especially nice: the clearly titled sections that explain the problem, what caused it, what they were doing about it, how to tell if you were affected, what to do if your account was affected, and an apology.</p>


<blockquote>For anyone who was inconvenienced by the interruption of service and/or irretrievable data, myself and the entire FreshBooks teams are deeply sorry. I want to extend our thanks to those of you who called and emailed to enquire about the problem. To a person, everyone was polite and understanding, which under the circumstances, was greatly appreciated by myself and the other FreshBooks staff who were hard at work bringing the service back online.</blockquote>

	<p>The result? Impressed customers who left raves like these:</p>


<blockquote>Thanks for the open communication and commitment to quick resolution during this ordeal.</blockquote>

<blockquote>I for one greatly appreciate your detailed information, acknowledgement of the problem, and your willingness to provide your clients with some perks to make up for the inconvenience. Outstanding customer service is <strong>very</strong> hard to come by nowadays. I am a new trial FB user who is now sold, if I wasn&#8217;t already!</blockquote>

<blockquote>I appreciate the honesty, dedication and commitment on the part of the FreshBook staff.</blockquote>

	<p><strong>Dreamhost&#8217;s anatomy of a(n ongoing) disaster</strong><br />
Dreamhost handled a similar rough patch with a <strong>long</strong> explanation peppered with tongue in cheek images of disaster scenes. The level of detail is impressive though it&#8217;s probably a good idea to offer some sort of Cliff Notes version for people who don&#8217;t want to read through that much text.</p>


<blockquote>Our number one priority right now is getting this nagging network problem understood and fixed. Once that&#8217;s the case, we should be able to put things back in Alchemy, who didn&#8217;t lose power on Friday at least. Once things are going good there, we&#8217;ll be able to add new servers and transition old ones slowly with little to no downtime.<br /><br />

	<p>We&#8217;re also going to be buying our own UPSes, since we have learned we can&#8217;t trust our data center OR our building to do it. We&#8217;ll start by putting the core routers on them, then our internal databases and servers, then our file servers, and finally the hundreds of customer mail, web, and database servers.</blockquote></p>

<p>We&#8217;re looking for video clips of Basecamp customers telling us why they love Basecamp. If we use your clip to promote the product, you&#8217;ll get a $250 voucher for Basecamp.</p>


	<p><strong>What should I say?</strong><br />
Tell us why you love Basecamp, how you use it, how it&#8217;s helped you, what you would say to recommend it to a friend, and/or anything else you&#8217;d like to share. No fancy production skills required &mdash; what you have to say is what matters here. Also, screenshots aren&#8217;t necessary. We want your story, not a tour of the product. A simple shot of your head while you talk is fine.</p>


	<p><strong>How long should it be?</strong><br />
Clips need to be under three minutes.</p>


	<p><strong>How do I submit a video?</strong><br />
Option 1: Use a <a href="http://www.workhappy.net/file_uploading_services/index.html">file uploading service</a> like <a href="http://www.mediafire.com/">MediaFire</a>, <a href="http://www.dropsend.com/">DropSend</a>, <a href="http://www.yousendit.com/">YouSendIt</a>, or <a href="http://www.boxcloud.com/">BoxCloud</a>. Send it to svn [at] 37signals [dot] com.</p>


	<p>Option 2: Upload the clips to your own server and send the link to svn [at] 37signals [dot] com.</p>


	<p>Also, make sure to include your Basecamp <span class="caps">URL</span>.</p>


	<p>Important: Please do not email the video clip directly to us. Also, do not use a video-sharing site like YouTube.</p>


	<p><strong>Is there a deadline?</strong><br />
No, but videos that get here sooner rather than later may have an advantage.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve long been fascinated with movie reviewer Jeff Craig of Sixty Second Preview, a man who seems to love bad movies. About &#8220;Swordfish,&#8221; he said, &#8220;One of the most breathlessly entertaining releases of the summer. You&#8217;ll be pinned to your seat by Swordfish.&#8221; &#8220;The Chamber&#8221; was &#8220;an explosive, gripping drama!&#8221; And &#8220;Free Willy <span class="caps">III</span>&#8221; was breathtaking.</p>


	<p>So who is Jeff Craig and what is Sixty Second Preview? <A HREF="http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/2006/08/18/08"><span class="caps">NPR</span> tried to track him down</a> but couldn&#8217;t.</p>


<blockquote>The Kevin Pollack/Sheryl Lee Ralph vehicle, titled &#8220;Deterrence,&#8221; wasn&#8217;t one of the top ten of the year, it was one of the most important films of our time. Now, there&#8217;s a movie lover. So we naturally wanted to speak to him, but we couldn&#8217;t find &#8220;Sixty Second Preview&#8221; &mdash; not any trace of it anywhere we looked. We don&#8217;t even know what medium it is.</blockquote>

	<p>Roger Ebert also asked, &#8220;Has anyone ever actually seen Jeff Craig of &#8216;Sixty Second Previews&#8217; at a movie? For that matter, does anyone know what &#8216;Sixty Second Previews&#8217; is? I ask in all sincerity.&#8221;</p>


	<p>Little Rock native Ron Breeding <a href="http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4155/is_20010701/ai_n13917165">has an answer</a>:</p>


<blockquote>I once worked for a radio station that aired &#8220;Sixty Second Previews,&#8221; a daily modular program one minute in length. Jeff Craig is the host of the thing, but since the program comes on CD a month at a time, he apparently hasn&#8217;t actually seen most of the movies &mdash; thus &#8220;previews,&#8221; not &#8220;reviews.&#8221; Still, his gushing about an upcoming movie he hasn&#8217;t yet seen ends up being used as blurbs in movie ads.</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/30/fashion/30FREE.html?ei=5090&#38;en=f6ebc87137995d85&#38;ex=1322542800&#38;partner=rssuserland&#38;emc=rss&#38;pagewanted=all">800 Very Unsquare Feet</a> describes Free City Supershop, an unorthodox Malibu retail space, as &#8220;a new shopping experience equal in its fun and sense of surprise to that of Whole Foods or Apple.&#8221; Owner Nina Garduno&#8217;s mantra is &#8220;make things with the simplest elements with the highest of possibilities.&#8221; She differentiates the store from larger competitors by emphasizing attention to detail, authenticity, and faith.</p>


	<p><img src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/30free.2.190.jpg" width="190" height="291" alt="Free City Supershop" /> <img src="http://www.37signals.com/svn/images/30free-2.3.190.jpg" width="190" height="239" alt="Free City Supershop" /></p>


<blockquote>According to Ms. Garduno, Free City is profitable. It took her eight days, working with a shoestring budget and a small team in her workshop in Hollywood, to create the store&#8217;s interior, which features redwood shelves and blowups of album covers. Like everything else about Free City, the design follows Ms. Garduno&#8217;s mantra to &#8220;make things with the simplest elements with the highest of possibilities.&#8221;...<br /><br />

	<p>&#8220;The big companies were taking the importance of fashion away, the craft, and making it about price,&#8221; she said&#8230;For something to be perceived as authentic, that value has to be communicated cleanly through every detail — from the quality of the wash, if it&#8217;s a T-shirt, to the integrity of the physical environment. This is the almost visceral sense you get when you enter Free City. Not to sound crunchy, but you feel the love.</p>


	<p>&#8220;Well, go look at the Gap. They claim to not want to rip you off, but the fact is they do. And it&#8217;s not working for them — not even lifting my ideas, and with all of their money and art direction. They still don&#8217;t have faith. They don&#8217;t have faith in themselves, and it comes out instinctually in the product. I think people know the difference.&#8221;</blockquote></p>


	<p><strong>More on tees and details</strong><br />
And speaking of tees and communicating quality through detail: Threadless, dissatisfied with existing options for blank tees, <a href="http://www.threadless.com/news/88235/EXCITING_NEWS_ABOUT_THE_TEES_WE_PRINT_ON">recently decided to start manufacturing its own</a>.</p>


<blockquote>These shirts are based on our experience as a tee shirt company, and the feedback we&#8217;ve gotten from our community since the beginning of Threadless. Imagine a tee that is less boxy than a Fruit of the Loom, but not as skinny as an American Apparel. Imagine a tee whose fabric is softer than American Apparel but not as thin.</blockquote>

	<p>Great example of paying attention to <strong>core</strong> detail (people may like the designs but if the shirts don&#8217;t fit right, it&#8217;s all moot) and knowing what your community wants (Fruit of the Loom = too boxy, American Apparel = too thin). Plus, there&#8217;s something Apple-esque here in the way Threadless didn&#8217;t just accept the limits of existing manufacturers and decided to find their own (better) solution.</p>
