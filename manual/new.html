	<h3>Manage Languages</h3>

	<p>
		LiveCart supports multiple languages for the same system, which enables you to adjust your shop for international usage. You can translate both interface information (menus, captions, instructions, etc.), as well as most of the data, which is stored in the system, like product descriptions, category names and others. This may seem overhelming at first but as you will see there
	a couple of handy tools to help you deal with interface translations (see Live Translation).
	</p>
	
	<h3>Things you can DO</h3>
	<ul>	
		<li>To add a new language</li>
		<li>Modify translations <!-- (filter, search, browse through tree, enter, save) --></li> 
<!--	??	<li>To apply language to the interface</li> -->
		<li>Sort / Reorder languages (impact on "Chance Language" menu</li>
<!--		<li>Set Active / Inactive</li> --> <li>Enable or disable a language</li>
		<li>Set default language (interface lang. diference)</li>
		<li>Delete language</li>
<!--		<li>Find a SPECIFIC word</li> -->
	</ul>
	<br />

	<p>Adding a language is a one step task. Simply select language from the list and click OK. Added languages appear below automatically.</p>
	
	<p>To enter translations proceed to the Language translation page (link here?).</p>
	
	<p>To reorder languages click on any language and drag it around to set the preferred arrangement. Language arrangement affects the order in which languages are displayed in language switching menus.</p>
	
	<p>The newly added languages are inactive by default. You might want to keep a language inactive while you are still translating the interface or product data. To activate a language mark its check_box on the left of the flag icon. <!-- (Also) note that only active languages are available in the change iterface language meniu. -->
	To deactivate a language clear a check_box by the language you want to deactivate.</p>
	
	<p>To delete a language, hover over it and click the delete icon on the left</p>

	<p>To change default language... consequences...</p>
	
	<p>To apply new language to the interface, click Change Language in the LC's main window and choose a language from the list dipslayed. Note: if the language is not fully translated it will use translations from the default language to fill empty translations (see setting Default Language)</p>

	<h3>Editing Interface Translations</h3>

	<p>Before editing translations you can have them filtered by their current status in terms of translation process. You can select the following filtering options:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span style="background: #ffff99">All</span> – show all the existing words</li>
		<li><span style="background: #ffff99">Translated</span> – display only translated items</li>
		<li><span style="background: #ffff99">Not translated</span> – show items that have not been translated</li>
	</ul>
