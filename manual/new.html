	<h2>Languages</h2>
	<br />

	<h3>Manage Languages</h3>
	<p>LC allows/enables you to adjust your shop for international usage, to prepare translations for other languages you have to set the interface (objects')
	translations and all the available stock information (description details, for instance.). This may seem overhelming at first but as you will see there
	a couple of handy tools to help you deal with interface translations (see LiveTranslation)</p>
	

	<h3>Things you can DO</h3>
	<ul>	
		<li>To add a new language</li>
		<li>To set(edit) translations (filter, search, browse through tree, enter, save)</li> 
		<li>To apply language to the interface</li>
		<li>Sort / Reorder languages (impact on "Chance Language" meniu</li>
		<li>Set Active / Inactive</li>
		<li>Set default language (interface lang. diference)</li>
		<li>Delete language</li>
		<li>Find a SPECIFIC word</li>
	</ul>
	<br />

	<p>Adding a language is a one step task. Simply select language from the list and click OK.</p>
	<p>To enter translations proceed to the Language translation page (link here?).</p>
	<p>Added languages appear below automatically. To reorder languages click on any language and drag it around to set the preferred arrangement.</p>
	<p>All (the newly added)languages are inactive by default. You might want to keep a language inactive while you are still translating it. To activate a language mark it's check_box on the left of the flag icon. (Also) note that only active languages are available in the change iterface language meniu.
	To suspend a language clear a check_box by the language you want to deactivate.</p>
	<p>To delete a language, hover over it and click the delete icon on the left</p>
	<p>To apply new language to the interface, click Change Language in the LC's main window and choose a language from the list dipslayed. Note: if the language is not fully translated it will use translations from the dafault language to fill empty translations (see setting Default Language)</p>
	<p> </p>
	<p></p>
	<br />

	<p>Before editing translations you can have them filtered by their current status in terms of translation process. You can select the following filtering options:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><span style="background: #ffff99">All</span> – show all the existing words</li>
		<li><span style="background: #ffff99">Translated</span> – display only translated items</li>
		<li><span style="background: #ffff99">Not translated</span> – show items that have not been translated</li>
	</ul>
	<p>You can suspend a language by clearing the check_box (unchenking the box) in front of the language. All the languages are set Active by default.</p>
