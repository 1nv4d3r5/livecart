	<h3>Manage Attributes</h3>
	<p>
		Attributes allow (you) to describe product information more precisely as instead of providing all product specifications as free-form text, you can define a fixed set of attributes for each product category and have designated fields for entering each parameter of a product. It makes it easier for customers to compare common products and by using attributes you can create product filters, which make it easy for a customer to find the products that match his/her requirements in no time.
	</p>
	<p>
		Attribute allows grouping (filtering) products by specific property.
	</p>
	<p>
		For instance, if a customer is shopping for a new laptop and is particularly looking for an AMD processor and you have created a "Processor Type" attribute, the customer will be able to sort the whole list of laptops to display only AMD processor powered laptops with a single click. This way a customer will have an ability to select certain kind of processor without a need to browse through all the available types (thus restricting his/hes search to specific needs). Of course you can create (and you should) as many attributes as possible (for instance, for size, brand, capacity, price and so on) which will allow users to customize their search in the most effective way. Note that actual filtering options are set in the <a href="filters.html">Filters</a> section where you use category's attributes to create filters.</p>
	<p class="note">
		<strong>Note:</strong> Attributes have to be set up for each category individually. You can however set higher level (global) attributes to higher level categories when necessary. For example, if the Computers category has two subcategories for Laptops and Desktops, you can define the common attributes like processor type, speed, memory, etc. for the Computers category and Laptop/Desktop specific attributes (for example, battery life) to the respective categories. You can also define truly global attributes, which will be available for all categories by defining them for the root category.
