	<h3>Manage Filters</h3>

	<p>Filters is a tool designed to make product search easy. Imagine yourself looking for a black-colored 17” LCD monitor with speakers and not more than 8 ms response time, costing less than $200. Where would you start? Samsung, LG? LC introduces a common-sence solution, filter based system that allows you to cutomize your search the way YOU need it.</p> 
	
	<p>A customer may use as many filters as necessary. Our solution doesn’t force the customer to select the product in pre-set order, instead – the customer may filter the products by any property he likes at any point of the process.</p>

	<p>Think of as many filters as possible to create an efficient browsing system as users may be interested in many kinds of attributes your products have to offer (some may search for products by particular technical details and some may be interested in color or shape ;)</p>

	<p>To create filters you have to define attributes first. (Go to the <a href="attributes.html">Attributes</a> section to create attributes).</p>

	<h3>How do Filters work?</h3>
	<p>Each category must have at least one attribute assigned to it, for example, Monitors may have the following attributes: screen size, type (LCD/CRT), response time, etc. Now Filters is what actually uses attributes for creating certain (filtering) rules. For instance, Filter named "Processor Type" would use an attribute named "Processor types" (and its values) to generate a certain filtering rule (which normally would be a list of processor types). </p>
