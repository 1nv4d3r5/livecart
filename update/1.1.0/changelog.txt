* Live progress bar is displayed when applying mass actions to products/orders/users, which provides feedback on how much of the task is completed and how much is left
* Added ability to cancel mass actions (and rollback the changes)
* Improved data grid control - smoother scrolling and selected rows are highlighted with different background color

System improvements:
* Slightly reduced overall memory usage
* Extended capabilities of the controller plugin system - it is now possible to target parent controller classes as well, so it is now possible to assign a controller plugin to all actions within the store frontend, for example. It is also possible to execute plugins before executing the controller actions (a pre-filter) in addition to the previously available possibility to execute plugins before the controller actions.

System fixes:
* Fixed a problem that caused errors when using LiveCart in languages that were not covered by the I18Nv2 library (like Twi language)
* Transparent GIF and PNG images are now being resized correctly, keeping the transparency instead of setting black background.
* All prices and totals now have two decimals ($10.00 instead of $10 and $10.90 instead of $10.9)

* Multilingual data values were returned blank after changing the default store language if there were no values entered for the new default language

Front-end fixes:
* Fixed JavaScript warning in product page when switching to different image
