New payment modules:

* DIBS FlexWin
* Significant improvements to offline payments functionality. It is now possible to configure up to 3 offline payment methods, enter descriptions and payment instructions from backend (so it's no longer necessary to edit the templates) and configure data input fields for each payment method if it's necessary to collect any kind of extra information

New real-time shipping rate calculator:
* FedEx

New translations:
* Czech
* Hebrew
* Slovenian

Major feature additions:

* Ability to ship an order to multiple addresses
* Ability to assign a product to multiple categories
* Reorders - customers may replace their previous order with a couple of clicks

Pricing rule improvements:

Checkout and ordering improvements:
* Editing shipping or billing address in checkout no longer takes customer to the user account and can be done directly within the checkout address entry/selection page (if the customer has only one shipping/billing addresses - the most common case)
* Added configuration option for table rate shipping services to hide other services from selection if this service becomes available. This allows to create separate shipping methods for special conditions (for example, free shipping over certain order total) and have this shipping method selected automatically.
* Improved the layout of the payment page: payment methods and order overview are now displayed side by side in two columns
* Cardholder name is now editable in credit card details form, instead of fixing it to customer's name

* Display percentage discount total amount as a separate line item in shopping cart page

Inventory tracking improvements:

* Order cancellations return the reserved stock to inventory
* Out-of-stock items are automatically moved from cart to wish list
* It is no longer possible to order more items than in stock (unless back-ordering is enabled for the particular product)

Performance improvements:
* Added a built-in gzip compression for CSS and JS files, which can be used if the compression is not available at server level (the compressed files are 4-5 times smaller)
* Optimized CSS/JS file bundling - all JavaScript and CSS files are glued in one file respectively, to reduce the number of requests.
* Improved the use of browser caching of CSS/JS files, so browser doesn't even check if the files have changed until they actually change (again less server requests to make
* Pages are now gzip encoded even if gzip encoding is not configured at server level (usually reduces page HTML size by factor of 4-5)
* Lazy loading of the PHP classes - memory consumption and number of PHP file includes per request are reduced by around 20-25% with slight improvements in execution time as well

Frontend improvements:

It can be less than 1 for fractional unit products, for example, 0.25 to only allow ordering a weighable product in increments of 0.25 kg (0.25, 0.50, 0.75, etc.) and it can be more for all products - for example, to make pins orderable only in quantities by 100
* Fractional quantity products now have text input field for quantity entry instead of a select box
* Custom field data is now loaded automatically and is readily available for use in templates for all applicable record types - orders, users,categories, manufacturers, etc.
* Product SKUs are now displayed in invoices
* Product file downloads now work with extremely large files as well

SEO improvements:
* Added ability to configure a store headline from settings and more customization options for page titles
* Added ability to define default meta description value, which would be displayed in pages that do not have their own meta description available

CSS and theme improvements:
* Significant barebone theme improvements - CSS file has been cleaned up, optimized and reorganized. It is now much easier to build new themes upon the barebone theme, since it won't be necessary to override default settings as often as before.
* Added Right-to-Left script support for the all themes (usable with Hebrew, Arabic, etc. scripts)
* CSS files for all themes have been cleaned up optimized reducing CSS size by around 25%

Backend improvements:
* Added "Previous Orders" tab in customer's order management panel for ability to quickly access previous orders of the same customer

Tax and shipping calculation fixes and improvements:
* Added ability to apply different tax rates for shipping costs than for items themselves
* Taxes were calculated incorrectly when there were 2 or more applicable tax rates (for example, Canadian stores)
* Shipping rates that were defined in ranges of grams were sometimes not fetched correctly

Frontend fixes:
* Search engine hits to "Add to cart" and "Add to wishlist" links no longer create bogus shopping cart instances in database
