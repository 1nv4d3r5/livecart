Major additions:
* Product options - now it is possible to sell configurable products with various types of options, for example, clothing with different sizes, "buildable" products (like custom PC's), etc.

New translations:
* French
* Spanish

Payment gateway integrations:
* Added PayMate integration

Front-end improvements:
* Added a new layout block ROOT_CATEGORY which is intended for displaying the main categories of the store as tabs

Back-end improvements:
* Added warning message before changing the store base currency in backend (the prices are set to 0 unless they were previously entered in the new base currency)

Front-end fixes:
* Fixed a bug that caused PHP error when trying to apply manufacturer filter from store home page (in some cases)
* Fixed occasional problems with loading of customized templates
* Error pages (like error 404) now issue a proper HTTP status header

Back-end fixes:
* Languages can now be activated immediately after they are added, without the need to reload the backend page
* Fixed occassional problems with translation search

Installer fixes:
* Allow to install LiveCart with PHP's MySQL extension as well (instead of only mysqli)
